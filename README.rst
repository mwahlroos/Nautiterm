Nautiterm - Open a terminal of your choice from Nautilus
========================================================

Nautiterm is an extension to the Nautilus file manager that opens a terminal
window of your choice at the location of the selected folder.

The functionality is almost identical to other similar extensions, as well as
to the functionality provided by the Nautilus integration of Gnome Terminal,
available e.g. on Fedora as the ``gnome-terminal-nautilus`` package.

However, Nautiterm can be **configured to open the terminal emulator
of your choice**.

The default is still to open Gnome Terminal.

Dependencies
------------

The extension requires the following:

- Python 3.4 or higher, and Python 3 versions of the following
- Python bindings for the Nautilus Extension Framework (nautilus-python)
- PyGObject, i.e. Python bindings for the GObject library
- PyYAML

On **Fedora Linux** you can install the dependencies with the following command:

::

  sudo dnf install nautilus-python python3-yaml

On **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or later**, the following command should install the dependencies:

::

  sudo apt install python3-nautilus python3-yaml

This version of the extension requires Python 3. For older distributions where
the Nautilus Python bindings use Python 2.x, such as **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS**,
check out the older version in the python2-support branch.


Installing
----------

You can install the extension by copying the file ``open_terminal.py`` from
the ``src/nautiterm`` folder into the Nautilus Python extensions folder, which
is located at ``$HOME/.local/share/nautilus-python/``.
Running the following commands in the root folder of the Nautiterm repository
will copy the file into the correct location:

::

  mkdir -p $HOME/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions
  cp src/nautiterm/open_terminal.py $HOME/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions

After installing the extension, shut down Nautilus:

::

  nautilus -q

The extension should be enabled the next time Nautilus is started,
e.g. by opening a folder.

Basic use
---------

Right-click on a folder in Nautilus, or on the empty background of an opened
folder, and the context menu should contain an option for opening a terminal
at the location.

Configuration
-------------

Out of the box with no configuration, Nautiterm opens a new Gnome Terminal
window. To have it open a different terminal emulator, add a file named
``$HOME/.config/nautiterm.yml``, with the following contents:

::

  terminal: terminal_program

where ``terminal_program`` should be replaced with the executable name of your
desired terminal. For example, to have Nautilus open `Terminator`_ instead of
Gnome Terminal, the configuration would usually be

.. _Terminator: https://launchpad.net/~gnome-terminator

::

  terminal: /usr/bin/terminator

In the above, ``$HOME`` refers to your home directory. On Linux, the correct
full name of the configuration file would typically be
``/home/YOUR_USERNAME_HERE/.config/nautiterm.yml``.

Uninstalling
------------

You can uninstall the extension by removing the extension file:

::

  rm $HOME/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions/open_terminal.py

Caveats and TODO
----------------

There is no localization support yet.
